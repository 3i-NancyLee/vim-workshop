In Chapter 1, the treatment of access networks has been modernized, and the
description of the Internet ISP ecosystem has been substantially revised, accounting for the recent emergence of content provider networks, such as Google’s. The
presentation of packet switching and circuit switching has also been reorganized,
providing a more topical rather than historical orientation.

In Chapter 2, Python has replaced Java for the presentation of socket programming. While still explicitly exposing the key ideas behind the socket API, Python
code is easier to understand for the novice programmer. Moreover, unlike Java,
Python provides access to raw sockets, enabling students to build a larger variety
of network applications. Java-based socket programming labs have been
replaced with corresponding Python labs, and a new Python-based ICMP Ping
lab has been added. As always, when material is retired from the book, such as
Java-based socket programming material, it remains available on the book’s
Companion Web site (see following text).

In Chapter 3, the presentation of one of the reliable data transfer protocols has
been simplified and a new sidebar on TCP splitting, commonly used to optimize
the performance of cloud services, has been added.

In Chapter 4, the section on router architectures has been significantly updated,
reflecting recent developments and practices in the field. Several new integrative
sidebars involving DNS, BGP, and OSPF are included.
