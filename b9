Our book broke new ground 12 years ago by treating networking in a top-down manner—that is, by beginning at the application layer and working its way down
toward the physical layer. The feedback we received from teachers and students
alike have confirmed that this top-down approach has many advantages and does
indeed work well pedagogically. First, it places emphasis on the application layer
(a “high growth area” in networking). Indeed, many of the recent revolutions in
computer networking—including the Web, peer-to-peer file sharing, and media
streaming—have taken place at the application layer. An early emphasis on applicationlayer issues differs from the approaches taken in most other texts, which have only a
small amount of material on network applications, their requirements, application-layer
paradigms (e.g., client-server and peer-to-peer), and application programming interfaces. Second, our experience as instructors (and that of many instructors who have
used this text) has been that teaching networking applications near the beginning of
the course is a powerful motivational tool. Students are thrilled to learn about how
networking applications work—applications such as e-mail and the Web, which most
students use on a daily basis. Once a student understands the applications, the student
can then understand the network services needed to support these applications. The
student can then, in turn, examine the various ways in which such services might be
provided and implemented in the lower layers. Covering applications early thus provides motivation for the remainder of the text
